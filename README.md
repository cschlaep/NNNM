Nearly Naked Nearly Mile Website

This website was developed for the purpose of providing Boston locals with information about the NNNM event and the cause
that the event benefitted.  It also provides users to donate to the cause through MIT's third party giving website,
giving.mit.edu.

The website is currently running and can be accessed at nearlynaked.mit.edu.  It was developed in conjunction with MIT's
6.813 class: User Interface Design.  While functional, the limited time period available to develop the site caused
potential styling improvements, such as window resizing issues, navigation, etc., to go as of yet unimplemented.
